 DevOps Cloud Engineer Training – Day 5 | Interview-Focused Learning

As a student, I attended today’s DevOps Cloud Engineer session, which was highly valuable and focused on building strong fundamentals for real-world interviews and industry expectations.

What I learned in today’s session:
Practiced DevOps interview questions with detailed discussion and real-time examples
Understood how to structure answers logically instead of memorizing responses
Covered Git command interview questions, including their practical use cases
Learned how Git commands are used in real projects for version control, collaboration, and troubleshooting

The session helped me connect theoretical knowledge with practical scenarios, especially how tools like Git are used in day-to-day DevOps workflows. Practicing interview questions with real-time examples gave me better clarity on what interviewers expect and how to explain concepts with confidence.

I’m truly thankful to my mentor Khushal Malik for the continuous guidance, clear explanations, and real-world insights. This mentorship is helping me build both technical skills and the right mindset required to grow as a DevOps Cloud Engineer.

Looking forward to applying this knowledge, improving my interview skills, and learning more in the upcoming sessions.
